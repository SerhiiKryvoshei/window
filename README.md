## Welcome! üëã

This project already has a connected slider in the form of a ready-made solution. That's all we were able to do. You do not need to touch it. It was left to keep the styles of the original project and support the mobile version. That is where it works.

## 1. When you click on this button [–í—ã–∑–≤–∞—Ç—å –∑–∞–º–µ—Ä—â–∏–∫–∞]:

The modal window (class popup_engineer) should be called
When you click on the cross or backing - disappear.

## 2. When you click on these captions

‚Äú–ó–∞–∫–∞–∑–∞—Ç—å –æ–±—Ä–∞—Ç–Ω—ã–π –∑–≤–æ–Ω–æ–∫‚Äù –∏ ‚Äú–°–ø—Ä–æ—Å–∏—Ç–µ —É –Ω–∞—à–µ–≥–æ —Å–ø–µ—Ü–∏–∞–ª–∏—Å—Ç–∞‚Äù

The modal window (class popup) should be called
When you click on the cross or backing - disappear.

## 3. Inside all modal windows there is a form

It should be sent via ajax (without reloading the page) and capture all the data entered. It is also necessary to notify the user of the sending status (sending, sent, error). In the field with the phone you can only enter numbers.
